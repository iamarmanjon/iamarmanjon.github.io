Someone shared this [article][1] in my facebook feed and it was a great read.

There’s 1 rule that really got my attention, and that is **Understanding how you fit in the bigger picture, goes a long way**.

For me this is the most important realization. For a while I jumped from company to company seeking my purpose, “my passion”, but what you really need to know is how you fit in the puzzle, how you can help your company in their mission.

With this in mind, every task you will do, every goal you want to reach, you know that you’re doing it for the best of your company. Your managers won’t need to micro-manage you, they’ll give you more autonomy on how you work out your tasks. Because they know, they can trust you.

Now, you will feel you belong and that there’s no contribution you make that is useless. **Everything has a purpose.**
