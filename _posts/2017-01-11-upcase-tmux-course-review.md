I just finished the whole day watching [Chris Toomey][christwitter]'s Tmux Workflow Course on [Upcase][tmuxlink]. It was awesome!
The course starts from an empty `.tmux.conf` file to a [full blowned one][tmuxconflink] that has all the bells and whistles of a great tmux
setup.

I dabbled in tmux before, trying out this **_terminal multiplexer_** as they call it. I really thought that it's just a fancy replacement for
splitting panes in your terminal. I am using [iTerm2][itermlink] as my terminal in mac os because it is very fast, customizable and __surprise__
I can split panes easily with keyboard shortcuts.

So if my terminal can already do that and if that's what tmux is about then why do I need to complicate myself with configurations and stuff
like that? Because I am wrong. Tmux can do that and **so muuuuch more**.

In this course you will learn:
- Why do you need tmux?
- What problem does it solve?
- How to get started easily without needing to understand all available commands
- Understand the sessions, windows and panes and how it can help you improve your dev setup
- Digestable config file for tmux (__you will understand EVERY LINE of it__)
- If you are using vim, you'll be suprised of the tricks on this course
- Workflow shorcuts and more...

This course is so practical that I can use it right now and improve my workflow by 100% **at least**!. So check it out guys, if you
