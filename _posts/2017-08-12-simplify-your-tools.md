Guitar gurus say, “Tone is in your fingers”. You can buy the same guitar, effects pedals, and amplifier that Eddie Van Halen uses. But when you play that rig, it’s still going to sound like you — Excerpt from [Rework][1].

I’m currently reading [Rework][1] by [Basecamp(formerly 37signals)][2] and I’m on the chapter where they talk about how the tools you used are not essentials to running your business. But use the one you already have or can afford and just go. It’s not the tools that matter but how you used it.

In my current work I am also simplifying my tools both hardware and software. I am a ruby developer by the way and mostly I used the [Rails Framework][3] for my everyday job. I also started to use the [Omakase Stack][4] that means using the gems that are included already in the framework. For deployment I enjoy how [Heroku][5] makes the ops simpler.

I started to use single monitor setup compare to dual/triple with a laptop. I’m using a 23–24" monitor with 1080p resolution so I still have plenty of space even though I only use 1 monitor. It also keeps me from juggling on all my available screens.

With these small little changes in my workflow, I expect to focus on the big things, solving the real problems, creating better quality software instead of thinking about the tools I used.

Here's my workspace at home.
